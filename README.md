# Prediction of the sales and demand for Walmart
Many household products are sold by various subsidiaries of the retail store network which are 
geographically located at various locations. Supply chain inefficiencies will occur at different 
locations when the market potential will not be evaluated by the retailers. The organization of 
retail store network must understand the market conditions to intensify its goods to be bought 
and sold so that many numbers of customers get attracted in that direction. Business forecast 
helps retailers to visualize the big picture by forecasting the sales, we get a general idea of coming 
years if any changes are needed then those changes are done in the retail storeâ€™s objective so 
that success is achieved more profitably. The forecasting of sales helps to know the retailers the 
demand of the product.
# DataSet
This data set is available on the kaggle website. These data sets contained features like stores, 
departments, temperature, Size, Size, unemployment, CPI, isHoliday, and MarkDowns. Total 
number of instances are 421570 in the dataset.
# Algorithm Used
This project is being approached by recurrent neural networks (RNN). LSTM network is a special 
model that forms by the Recurrent Neural Network. It is capable of learning long-term 
dependencies. LSTM network provides feedback connections; it avoids dependency (long-term) 
problems and solves vanishing and exploding gradients. This method is widely used for classifying 
and forecasting on time series dataset because it gives us more controllability and in a time series 
there are important durations where unknown periods happen during significant events.
